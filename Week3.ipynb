    "The red circle indicates the precision and recall that's achieved when the decision threshold is zero. So you can see that in this particular application there is a general downward trend. So as the precision of the classifier goes up, the recall tends to go down. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case you'll see also that It's not exactly a smooth curve. There are some jagged edges, and in fact the jumps tend to get a little bigger as we approach maximum precision. This is a consequence of how the formulas for precision and recall are computed. They use discrete counts that include the number of true positives. And so as the decision threshold increases, there are fewer and fewer points that remain as positive predictions. So the fractions that are computed for these smaller numbers can change pretty dramatically with small changes in the decision threshold, and that's why these sort of trailing edges of the Precision-recall curve can appear a bit jagged when you plot them.\n",

    "**ROC** curves or **receiver operating characteristic curves** are a very widely used visualization method that illustrate the performance of a binary classifier. ROC curves on the X-axis show a classifier's False Positive Rate so that would go from 0 to 1.0, and on the Y-axis they show a classifier's True Positive Rate so that will also go from 0 to 1.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal point in ROC space is one where the classifier achieves zero, a false positive rate of zero, and a true positive rate of one. So that would be the upper left corner of the plot. So just as in the precision recall case, as we vary decision threshold, we'll get different numbers of false positives and true positives that we can plot on a chart."

    "The dotted line here is the classifier curve that results from a classifier that randomly guesses the label for a binary class. So the dotted line here is used as a base line. A bad classifier will have performance that is close to this random curve (the dotted line). A reasonably good classifier will give an ROC curve that is consistently better than random across all decision threshold choices. And finally an excellent classifier would be one like the one plotted above, which is way up into the left. This particular example is the logistic regression classifier previously used in this notebook.\n",

That's the single number that measures this total area underneath the ROC curve as a way to summarize a classifier's performance. So, an AUC of zero represents a very bad classifier, and an AUC of 1 will represent an optimal classifier."
